# Named Entity Recognition (NER) Project with MLOps Implementation

Welcome to the Named Entity Recognition (NER) Project! This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to perform entity recognition on text data. Through the integration of MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) practices, we automate the process of model development, deployment, and monitoring, ensuring a streamlined and efficient workflow.

## Overview

The NER Project focuses on identifying and classifying named entities in text data, such as persons, organizations, locations, etc. By incorporating MLOps principles, we aim to create a scalable and reliable solution for entity recognition tasks.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into several components, each serving a specific MLOps purpose:

- **Setup**: Scripts and instructions for setting up the project environment, including creating a virtual environment, installing dependencies, and configuring Google Cloud Platform (GCP) CLI.

- **Data Ingestion**: Components for fetching, loading, and storing text data from external sources into GCP storage buckets for further processing.

- **EDA and Data Preprocessing**: Notebooks for exploratory data analysis and data preprocessing to prepare the text data for training.

- **Model Training**: Components for training NLP models, such as BERT-based models from Hugging Face, on the preprocessed data.

- **Model Evaluation**: Components for evaluating the performance of trained models using appropriate metrics and selecting the best-performing model for deployment.

- **Model Deployment**: Scripts, Dockerfiles, and instructions for deploying the selected model as a scalable service, leveraging Docker and Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) for hosting and management.

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Configuration files and workflows for implementing a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using CircleCI, automating testing, building Docker images, and deploying models with every code change.

## MLOps Implementation Highlights

This project demonstrates best practices in MLOps implementation, including:

- **Dockerization**: Containerizing the model training and deployment processes using Docker to ensure consistency and reproducibility across different environments.

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Setting up a robust CI/CD pipeline with CircleCI to automate testing, building Docker images, and deploying models to production environments.

- **Google Cloud Integration**: Leveraging Google Cloud services such as GCP storage buckets, GKE, and Artifact Registry for model hosting, storage, and infrastructure management.

## Usage

To get started with the project and experience the power of MLOps in action, follow these steps:

1. Set up your project environment by creating a virtual environment and installing dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file.

2. Configure Google Cloud CLI and authenticate with your GCP account using `gcloud init`.

3. Install PyTorch and other required libraries for training NLP models.

4. Add code to the exception, logger, and constants modules as per the provided instructions.

5. Create directories and add necessary files for storing data, models, and artifacts.

6. Set up GCP storage buckets for storing data and models, and configure access permissions accordingly.

7. Perform data ingestion and transformation tasks to prepare the text data for model training.

8. Train NLP models using BERT-based architectures and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics.

9. Deploy the best-performing model for real-time entity recognition using Docker and GKE.
